# PlainSight
A simple multiplayer game. Complete your objective without getting caught!

The application starts on a lobby screen. On different networks, the host/server should share their public ip; on the same network, their private ip. After pressing "Host Game", a connection can be made with another player via port-forwarding. The client should type in the appropriate ip address and press "Join Game". From there, either player can begin the game.

When the game begins, there are 12 red squares (2 players and 10 computers) and 4 larger black squares (pillars). Each player can identify themself with a "You" label visible only to them. Using the arrow keys, players can move their square in the cardinal directions. The goal is to touch each of the black squares
